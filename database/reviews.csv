JONATHAN ,Poor Soft lack memory 'my photo' 500MB USB2.0,"Concept great!! Implementation Poor. USB 2.0 port not able to display pictures directly and requires transfer to 'My Photo' area limited to 500 MB space. App size is over half used my application that can't be deleted that are preloaded. Samsung needs to remove the limitations by allowing deletion of preloaded apps and allow use of the USB ports to display directly for My Photos images. If done then product would be recommended.",4.5,8

Tonyea,Very easy setup I love the device for my TV,The streaming stick with very easy to set up on my TV.

The streaming device told me that it would not be able to control my volume. Is this common?,3,10
